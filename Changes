Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Diff.

0.07  Sat Jun 26
        - Fixed Dom's problem with trailing newlines, or rather the
          handling of undef passed in parameters to line_number
          and intradiff.

0.06  Sat May 15 12:30:07 2004
	- Looked at Earle's "false positive" problem with word matching
	- Made internal method calls visible, hence subclassable
	- changed to use Params::Validate for validation

0.05  Thu Dec 18 23:57:23 2003
	- Corrected another bug in the diffing. Was not correctly
	handling words that did not have an immediately following space.

0.04  Thu Dec 18 23:07:15 2003
	- Use VCS::Lite::Delta->hunks method call instead of 
	breaking encapsulation (needs VCS::Lite 0.05)
	- Allow selection of metadata variables
	- Fix a bug with <BR /> tags not being handled

0.03  Sun Dec 07 13:24:37 2003
	- Fix sort order for multiple metadata entries. This was
	causing tests to fail on some platforms.

0.02  Sat Dec 06 12:01:28 2003
	- Remove absorb of trailing punctuation in words as it's
	more trouble than it's worth. Fix dependency on CGI::Wiki.

0.01  Sat Nov 15 13:22:03 2003
	- Migrated from OpenGuides::Diff.pm
